# Netlify Function Auth Quickstart

Built on:

- Netlify - deploy and host and restrict access to paths if no token is present.
- Netlify Functions - run JS code in the cloud.
- Auth0 - control login.
- jQuery DataTables - create an HTML table using JS and JSON data.

The table portion where JSON data is pulled in and displayed as table is based on [Ajax sourced data](https://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/ajax.html) in the jQuery DataTables docs.
